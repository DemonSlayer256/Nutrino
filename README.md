# Nutrino

**Nutrino** is a web-based health application developed using Flask that helps users track their daily calorie intake. Designed with a focus on Indian cuisine, Nutrino enables individuals aiming to lose, gain, or maintain weight to monitor and manage their diet effectively. By providing personalized insights and a comprehensive database of Indian foods, Nutrino empowers users to make healthier choices and maintain a balanced diet. Also I thank [ChethanRaj13](github.com/ChethanRaj13) for that beautiful logo.
